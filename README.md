# Hello z/OS

"Hello World" in ASM and COBOL for the mainframe.
`cobol.sh` and `asm.sh`, which can be run under USS, submit JES jobs
that compile *and run* a Hello World program in COBOL and
z/OS assembler, respectively.
You will probably need to change the COBOL compiler location
in `hello-cobol.jcl` before the COBOL will compile correctly.
